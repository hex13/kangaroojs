==========

KangarooJS is message-driven game microframework written in JavaScript

Version 0.2 dev

now:

- each game entity is extendable via plugins
- message/event-driven approach
- decoupled modules (renderer, physics engine etc.): you can swap them without affecting the rest of the game.
- pseudoclassical hierarchy of entities - you can derive behaviours and attributes 
- support for UI: HTML based dialogs, in-game texts

partly:

- box2d integration

planned (NOT YET implemented):

- image preloader
- level loading
- screen stack
- canvas support
- graphic theme for casual games (stars, padlocks, level list etc.)
