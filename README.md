==========

KangarooJS (JavaScript message-driven game microframework)
Version 0.01 (early stages of development) 

now:

- each game entity is extendable via plugins
- message/event-driven approach
- decoupled modules (renderer, physics engine etc.): you can swap them without affecting the rest of the game.
- pseudoclassical hierarchy of entities - you can derive behaviours and attributes 

planned (NOT YET implemented):

- screen stack
- level loading
- support for UI (HTML based dialogs), in-game texts
- graphic theme for casual games (stars, padlocks, level list etc.)
